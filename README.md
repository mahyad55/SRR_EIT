#  Super-resolution reconstruction of electrical impedance tomography images    #



This is the authors' implementation of [1].

The code is implemented in MATLAB and includes:  
-  main.m   - a demo script that super-resolves a breathing lung sequence  
-  ./hs/    - Horn and Schunck image registration algorithm  
-  README   - this file
